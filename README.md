# hello-world

I'm a manager & director with a non-profit that runs a haunted house. We raise money for a cancer-related charity & the community. I help create special FX for the haunt & help people find the tools they need for whatever job they are trying to perform. I also help organize stuff & assist in purchasing new stuff when needed. I love to learn, create new things, & meet new people. For years I've wanted to learn more about coding and software design & development. This is the start of my latest adventure.
